# Image Classification using VGG16

This project demonstrates **image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based on the **VGG16 architecture**. The model leverages **transfer learning with ImageNet pre-trained weights** to classify images from a custom dataset. The complete implementation, including preprocessing, training, and evaluation, is provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- VGG16 (ImageNet pre-trained model)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

- The VGG16 model successfully learned meaningful features from the image dataset.  
- Training and validation accuracy showed steady improvement across epochs.  
- Loss curves indicated stable model convergence.  
- The results confirm the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classification tasks.

## Future Scope

- Add a confusion matrix and detailed classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).  
- Experiment with deeper or lightweight architectures such as VGG19, ResNet, or MobileNet.  
- Fine-tune additional layers to further improve accuracy.  
- Deploy the trained model as a web or mobile application for real-time image classification.
